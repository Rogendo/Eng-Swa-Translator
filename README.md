# English to Swahili Translator

#### 1.1 Problem Statement
The problem of translating English to Swahili presents several challenges, primarily due to the linguistic
differences between the two languages. Machine translation has made significant advancements, but there
is room for improvement in achieving accurate and contextually relevant translations. This project aims to
address these challenges and enhance the quality of English to Swahili translations using Natural
Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

#### 1.2 Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:
1. Develop a robust English-to-Swahili translation model: Create a machine translation model
capable of accurately translating English text into Swahili while preserving context and meaning.
2. Improve translation quality: Enhance the fluency, coherence, and accuracy of translated text to
make it more natural and contextually relevant for Swahili speakers.
3. Handle various text types and domains: Ensure the translation model can handle diverse text
types, including formal documents, informal conversations, technical content, and more.
